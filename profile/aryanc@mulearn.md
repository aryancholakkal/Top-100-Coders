### About Me

> I am currently a third year student in B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering. My journey has always been for my unquenched thirst for knowledge. I have a foundation in coding. Furthermore, my interest in AI and Data Science has enabled me to learn about various concepts.
I am actively engaged in projects that aim to assist differently abled children by means of technology and interactive applications.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- Currently holding position as Technical Lead in IEDC, has organized and conducted many events like IoT Bootcamps and various other.

#### Networking: 

- Bieng a part of IEDC, I had connecred with various other collages execoms which promoted my experience level.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- As a student who envisions to reach the peak of AI and Data Science or at least leave a lasting impression on it, I have never been in a professional environment wherein I could apply my skills to their best. I expect being a part of top 100 will give me an opportunity to show the world what I can do in my realm, if given a chance.
- Like I mentioned before, I am very keen on the fact that I would like to give back to the very society that nurtured me. That being said, I would not like to forget my roots, and hence take up one, if not many of the tasks or innovations and implement them in the best fashion possible.

#### Career Plan: 

- My immediate plans are to get into  AI & DS and then from there expand my knowledge as required. I would not like to limit myself to a particular field, nor would I like to be a Jack of all trades. Hence I picked these two domains to remain committed to, both in the short term, as well as the long term and leave a lasting impact or a relatable vision that the future leaders of my country can pick up on.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has many a numerous, vibrant students which are been enlighted during last few years. There can be a exponential growth in Kerala's Tech Ecosystem.
